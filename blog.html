	<h2>Is Neuroeconomics the death of free will?</h2>
	<div>
"Neuroeconomics: Using Neuroscience to Make Economic Predictions"
Neuroeconomics can be classified as a new field, its ground comes from psychology, economics, and neuroscience knowledge. And it has been gaining the spotlight since the early 2000s. While attending the course, I was faced with the following question: “Do people have free will, or is this universal belief an illusion? Is Neuroeconomics the death of free will?”</div>

<p>When considering the realm of human decision making it is tempting to draw conclusions about our capacity for Free Will. Are our decisions already made for us by our brains before we become aware of them?

Well, I gained some amazing insights on this topic from the mentioned course, I would love to explain some of them here,

 Benjamin Libet conducted experiments using EEG to detect neural activity in participants prior to performing a motor function.

He designed an experiment where a participant had to place his index finger at their preferred position on a clock with a moving object(dot). He demonstrated that neural activity occurs around 200ms prior to conscious awareness of the decision to perform the voluntary action. That leaves the conscious mind only 100-150ms to become aware of the decision before that action is carried out by the motor cortex. He later suggested that this short timeframe of awareness could be used to ‘veto’ a decision prior to action.</p>

 
<p>
The Ultimatum Game experiment 
This experiment shows us the role of emotion in the decision-making process.

The game has the following rules:

Player A gets a definite amount of money.
Player A is given a task to split this sum of money into two unquantified parts between him/her and Player B.
Player B can either accept or reject their part of the money decided by Player A.
If Player B rejects, None of them receive any money.
If Player B accepts, Money is split according to the proposal.
The results showed that Player B usually rejects the proposal if they get an unfair offer by Player A.

Using fMRI, we can see that activity in the areas of the brain associated with a negative emotional response can lead to irrational decision making. Relatively higher activation in the emotional centers (anterior insula) than in the logical centers (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) predicts that a participant will reject an ‘unfair’ cash offer. This correlation between the activity of specific neural networks and irrational decision making suggests that our emotional response is a predictor of our decision making. However, in a real-world scenario, decision making occurs over multiple steps with multiple variables. If the Ultimatum Game experiment was conducted with different parameters, such as giving the participant more time to accept or reject the ‘unfair’ offer, it would be interesting to test how the results might change once the initial emotional impact had subsided. We cannot say for certain that our brains pre-program our decisions without the assistance of our conscious awareness, as many variables need to be considered.</p>

 
<p>
Although EEG and fMRI can measure neural activity, the exact meaning of that activity cannot be determined. Therefore, in Libet’s experiments, we cannot assume that the neural activity represents a decision, an urge, an idea, a want, or something else. The neural activity observed could represent the initiation of a decision, which is not a final predictor of whether an action will be carried out or not. In other words, we have Free Will to be able to choose our own actions despite what urges arise.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on these experiments? Please share your views in the comments section! I am planning to draft a series of articles on Neuroeconomics.

Stay tuned, for more articles on this topic in the near future!</p>

	<h2>Brain Anatomy and Key Neuroimaging Techniques</h2>
	<div>In this article of the Neuroeconomics series, I will share some Brain Anatomy and Neuroimaging techniques which I learned while exploring this field. As we know, the brain is a very complex device. The brain consists of billions of neurons, and each neuron has thousands of connections, so all together it makes the most complex device in the universe. Some neuroscientists are really sceptical whether we can really fully understand the system, but other neuroscientists are more optimistic. The neuron is our basic unit of the brain. neuron consists of their cell body, of dendrites, and of the axon.

If we will simply slice the brain, we will see immediately a large difference between gray and white matter, gray matter consists of cell bodies, and most of the neuroeconomic studies focus on the gray matter. White matter consists of axons. So, basically white matter consists of connections between different brain regions. We can divide the brain in four major regions : frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and temporal lobe.  </div>

	<h1>How our brain makes the decisions?</h1>
	<p>
So, first, sensory evidences for different options are accumulated by the brain and next our brain makes decisions. It compares options and select certain behavioural patterns. So overall, according to Neuroeconomics theory, when we make a decision, when we make a selection between two options, first our brain processes objects and next we make a decision. So, at the next stage, decision making neurons are processing the information and create and produce a decision.</p>

	<h3>Lesions</h3><p>Lesions can trigger some changes in our behaviour and also in, in the way we make our decisions. There are really famous cases, illustrating how the trauma in the specific brain area can lead to specific changes in our decision making. It can stimulate certain brain regions, especially in the hypothalamus which can trigger aggressive behaviour.

ex: animal behaves aggressively if you stimulate the very specific region of the hypothalamus.</p>

	<h3>TMS</h3>
	<p>Another way to stimulate the human brain and without any damage to the brain is Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). In TMS, by rapidly changing magnetic field, we can induce inside of the brain some rapidly changing electrical currents, that disturb the activity of neurons. So by single magnetic pulse, we can temporarily, quickly disturb activity of certain neuronal population while there're repeated magnetic pulses. We will see that by trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, we can change our decisions.

Neuroeconomics also states that TMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, leads to the higher acceptance rate of the unfair financial offers. We start to agree with unfair financial offers. So by trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, we can change the decision making easily.</p>

<h3>EEG and MEG</h3>
<p>
We can also use EEG and MEG to study the activity of large portions of the human brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to the electrical activity produced by the firing of neurons. And Magnetoencepholography (MEG) is sensitive to the magnetic fields produced by active neurons.

Let's take an example:

A game is played between two players: Player A and Player B. Each player has a penny. Player A is told to secretly turn the penny (heads/tails) and if the pennies match both heads, or both tails, Player A keep both pennies. If the pennies do not match, Player B keeps both pennies. We can record evoked responses to the outcome of this game. In this case, we see evoked responses to the losses and to the wins during the matching penny game. When the person looses money, we see a peak around 250 milliseconds in the EEG and this peak is particularly strong when person change decision in the next round. We see that the peak is particularly strong when subject changes the decision in the next trial. So, we can predict the decision based on the both response, based on the event-related potential.

This method helps us to really investigate the dynamic of the decision making process, with the millisecond precision. We can also record our activity of the brain using MEG which measures the magnetic fields produced by the active neurons. So overall, MEG and EEG methods are strongly recommended if we would like to study different stages of decision making. Both methods have excellent time resolution. EEG method is quite cheap, but MEG device is relatively expensive.</p>

<h3>fMRI</h3>
<p>
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI) is the most popular method in Neuroeconomics. It's a quite complex method. We put a subject inside of the magnet, their head will be surrounded by a few different coils. When we put a subject inside the fMRI scanner, the protons are aligned, in line with the strong magnetic field. Next, we apply to the brain the excitation radio frequency magnetic field. And this magnetic field activates protons. When we switch off this magnetic field, we can record the magnetic field emitted by the activated protons.

We can also use another protocol called functional MRI, with this protocol, with this sequence of pulses, we can collect the activation of different brain areas during the task. We can record the brain activity during the decision making process. So in this case, we put our subject inside of the scanner and we ask subject to make decisions inside of this camera. Basically when we make some calculations, our brain is activated, so neurons, need more energy. They need more oxygen. It triggers an inflow of blood to the brain. And it changes the weight of the brain.

So, this experiment actually explains the principle of the fMRI method. Our brain is penetrated by blood vessels. So, these blood vessels bring oxygen to neurons. And whenever our neurons are active, it triggers an inflow of blood, an inflow of oxygenated haemoglobin an inflow of energy to this region and this inflow of oxygenated haemoglobin changes in magnetic properties of the tissue and can detected by the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. So, when the neurons are active, when they produce a lot of action potentials as they need a lot of energy.

So, with functional MRI, we record the inflow of oxygenated haemoglobin to the region, so we record the neural activity indirectly. So normally we combine different methods to understand different aspects of decision making. Unfortunately, these techniques require laboratory experiment. That's why, we cannot sometimes conduct studies of real life decisions.</p>

<p>I hope I was able to explain these techniques in a simplified manner.

	<h2>Diffusion Model Of Brain</h2>
	<div>The Diffusion Model takes into account the reaction time distribution of both correct and erroneous responses from binary decision tasks. These tasks include making a decisions between any two choices available at a given instance of time. The higher degree of information usage allows the estimation of different parameters mapping cognitive components such as speed of information accumulation. Let's understand some terminologies of the diffusion model.</div>

<p>Drift rate informs about the speed and direction of information accumulation by the brain. Positive/Negative drift rate indicate an average slope of information accumulation towards the Upper/Lower threshold. The absolute value of drift rate can be interpreted as a measure of subjective task difficulty which means absolute drift rates will be higher for easier tasks.</p>
<p>
Threshold separation represents the chosen response criterion. This is the upper limit for the brain beyond which it has to take a decision based on the information it has accumulated.

Diffusion model is related to decision making. Neurons are programmed to transform the sensory information into decision. Our brain is very sensitive to motion information, it can instruct a lot of complex information from moving patterns, for this there are specialised neurons.</p>

<p>

Let us understand this by a  perceptual discrimination task which states that there are a lot of dots moving in a particular direction on a screen. If the majority of dots are moving right, the viewer has to switch their gaze towards right and if not then, towards left. If all dots are moving randomly then it becomes a difficult task to take a decision for the brain to switch their gaze. There are certain specialised neurons in every area of brain that are sensitive to information collected by various sensory information sources and their task is to take the decision according to the movement of dots in that particular direction. If the activity of the decision making neurons and the integrator neurons that integrate the decisions crosses the decision threshold, the decision is finalised.

Accumulation of information leads to an activity in the decision neurons which enables the firing of signals. When the firing rate reaches a certain decision threshold, we can predict the behaviour/outcome of the decision.</p>

<h3>The actual flow of neurons for decision taking process : </h3>
<p>

Middle Temporal (MT) area of brain (cerebral cortex) which lies in Dorsal stream of the visual area of primate brain detects some motion.
Lateral Intra-parietal (LIP) cortex area of the brain (Intraparietal sulcus of the brain) is most likely involved in eye movement, as the electrical stimulation evokes quick movement of the eyes, LIP integrates this information over time and at the same time neurons inhibit alternative decisions, and finally if the activity or one of this integrator reaches a decision making. It activates the motor neurons.
Frontal Eye Field (FEF) takes the final decision. This region contains the motor neurons which carry the decision activation.
</p>
<p>

There are some other models like the Race Model (according to Race model decisions making neurons will gradually increase activity proportional to the evidences for the alternatives). The Diffusion Model is considered better than the Race Model as the Diffusion model reacts adaptively to the levels of evidences supporting the alternatives, and this adaptive mechanism is not present in the race model. The human brain's decision making is closely based upon the diffusion model according to the research.
</p>
<p>
I hope you got a brief understanding about the diffusion model of brain.

	<h2>NATION = MINDSET</h2>
<div>India, The nation with a population of 1.3 billion with more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35 years. The nation with infinite resources, humongous market, diverse and dense terrain. The nation with the oldest and the richest history and diverse cultures. The nation that is believed to be “the mother” of all religions, castes, creeds, and races. The nation that ensures equality, freedom, sovereignty and much more than any country on this globe can, has every possible parameter to be the supreme global leader. So what’s stopping us from gaining and acquiring the crown?
</div>
<p>
The simple answer is the Mindset. We have got everything with us but we haven’t got the thing which is the core reason for the existence of everything!!!
We are well aware of the fact that everything we have today is a by-product of a simple or maybe a complex idea that popped into someone’s mind. We know that the abstract creates the tangible but the only problem we are facing today as a nation is the lack of those basic yet important concepts. We need to become a producer and not a consumer. We need to produce and develop a strong and persistent mindset. We need to welcome and adopt necessary changes.
</p>

<p>
The change starts with us. The change starts within us and the change starts amongst us.</p>
<p>

Let’s understand this theory of transformation by taking an example of a small yet capable country like UAE. I got a chance to visit Dubai two years ago and I was amazed to learn about its transformation story!!!
A desert, a land with almost no vegetation, natural resources or population about 25 years ago transformed into a lush green, ultra modern and high tech city in no time. The reason for this miracle is the mindset. The mindset of the rulers or the leaders of Dubai was very clear. They wanted the change and they embraced the change with no second thought. They had the urge to be the best and create the tallest, strongest, fastest and richest structures on their land. Well, not only on the land but on the water ( Palm Islands) as well. This explains the real power of a positive, clear and bold mindset in building a nation. You don’t need to have multiple resources, you just need to have an effective mindset.</p>
<p>

As discussed, we are a thousand times more capable than any other nation to emerge as a superpower. All we need to have is the correct leaders with the correct mindset to achieve the feats of glory.

So, choose your leaders wisely whose mindset is to develop and transform the nation and not to transform their assets or banks exponentially.

	<h2>Mediocrity might be a success!</h2>
<div>In this increasingly competitive world, we often doubt ourselves if we’re good enough in our abilities to match up with others. We often get demotivated and depressed if we aren’t successful in matching up with what we had expected. The question which often arises in the mind of a person with mediocre abilities is will he be able to sustain himself in this ruthless world? Is it necessary to be exceptional? He sometimes even feels that he’s being cheated by himself. It’s not a very comfortable state for him.</div>
<p>

I will like to take the help of one of my favorite film “Forrest Gump” to answer this. Forrest is a person with mediocre abilities and low IQ. Still, he finds success in everything he puts himself in.
The movie teaches us a strong lesson that you don’t need to be an exceptionally smart person to achieve glory. If we start seeing the life from Forrest Gump’s point of view, it would be so beautiful. He is so pure in every aspect. The best thing is he is not at all judgemental about anybody around him or himself. This is something stunning. You have to let go of the past, Whether it was good or bad. Regretting about the past doesn’t make any sense after all.</p>
<p>

The film is the juxtaposition between Forrest and Jenny. Jenny, right from her childhood, knows her calling, is ambitious and goes after her vocation. Forrest, on the other hand, is ‘floating around accidentally’ in his life. The ambitious Jenny ends up adopting a disturbed, sad and disease-ridden life. The shy, brainless, naive Forrest lives a ‘prosperous’ and ‘successful’ life. This irony lies in the central frame of the film. The film also comments, and to some extent discards the populist belief of ‘finding one’s passion’. The voice-less Forrest is not ‘born’ to do anything, does not have valid reasons to take the jobs he takes. He just does. He puts his total self into whatever he does and finds success. Maybe passion is unreal.
</p>
<p>
The film teaches us that you may not be blessed with intelligence, good looks, good parenting, good social status or any other common predictors for success but having a good heart and constant hard work can make all the difference in the world. Sometimes, It’s not necessary to have a solid plan to do something. Like Forrest, Don’t take life too seriously, Let life take its course by itself and cherish what comes next. Do whatever you want irrespective of what others say.</p>
<p>

I will like to end this by mentioning what Forrest says,
” My momma always said, Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get. “</p>

<h2>Do animals meditate ?</h2>
<div>Suddenly out of no where a question popped into my mind that do animals other than us meditate? Do they have a spiritual side? I researched a lot about this and found that the answer is “Yes”. You heard me right!!! Animals do meditate. The only difference is that they meditate quite differently from us.</div>
<p>

Animals don’t have much freedom on behavior and mind. Naturally they are fixed to do what they’re supposed to do. Though animals vary and the behavior of animals from the same category varies as well but we can only observe a little difference in it. So how do they meditate?</p>
<p>

To understand this we need to understand what meditation is. Meditation is a practice where an individual teaches himself to stay alert, stay calm and achieve a peaceful and clear state of mind. Meditation is not about “doing”, it’s about “observing”. From observing I mean observing ourselves and not reacting to the external world. It’s about staying alert and not migrating to your future or past. Human beings, unlike other animals are trapped into compulsive thinking and our brain is designed in a way that there are no limits on what we think or imagine.According to research, nearly about 70 thousand thoughts pop into our head everyday out of which a very few are somewhat close to the reality. Hence, we meditate to pay attention to the reality or this very moment we’re in.</p>
<p>

Animals on the other hand who have a fixed behavior are always alert. They are in the state of meditation in every moment of their existence. They aren’t trapped into obsessive thinking as most of us are. They can “bliss out” quite easily. Unlike us they don’t think compulsively. They are always in the present moment reacting to the circumstances they’re in. Animals unknowingly meditate every time. If you observe a dog, it is always alert. Even when it is sleeping, it is connected to universal consciousness. Unlike us animals don’t think,imagine,analyze,plan or remember things which helps them to have a free mind all the time. It is a natural state for them.
